void main(){
  print("this is the main method or you can also call it the main function");
  // in every program that is written ... the main method is required as this tell the compiler or interpreter that is in charge of converting the program written in high level language to binary(source code) so that the cpu can process those instructions, that this very function is the starting point where the program should be executed from.
  //this sort of structure is very common in object oriented and statically typed languages like java and others..

  // #gemini's comment -

  /// The `main` function is the necessary entry point for every Dart application.
  /// When a program is run, the Dart runtime looks for this function to know
  /// where to begin execution.
  ///
  /// This convention is common in many other languages, such as Java, C++, and C#.
